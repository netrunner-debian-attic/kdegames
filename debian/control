Package: kbounce
Architecture: any
Section: games
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: Jezzball clone for the K Desktop Environment
 This is a clone of the popular Jezzball game originally created by
 Microsoft. Jezzball is one of the rare and simple games requiring
 skill, timing, and patience in order to be successful.  A ball begins
 to bounce off of an area enclosed by four borders (like a
 square). You must move your pointer to certain areas within the
 square. Upon clicking, a new border is constructed at a relatively
 quick pace. You can change the direction of the borders by 90 degrees
 as well. Ultimately, you must force the ball to bounce around in a
 smaller, and smaller area as time goes by without the ball ever
 touching the borders as they are being constructed. If a ball touches
 a certain part of the border as it is being built, the game is over.
 After 75% of the original space has been blocked off from the moving
 ball, you advance one level, and one more ball is added to the mix in
 the following level.
 .
 This game was previously known as kjezz.

 the gold nuggets, then you can climb up into the next level.  Your
 enemies are also after the gold and they will kill you if they catch
 you!

 run away, dig holes in the floor to trap them or lure them into some
 area where they cannot hurt you.  After a short time a trapped enemy
 climbs out of his hole, but if it closes before that, he will die and
 reappear somewhere else.
